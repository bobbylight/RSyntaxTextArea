* About RSyntaxTextArea

  RSyntaxTextArea is a syntax highlighting text component, written in Swing.
  It allows applications to easily embed syntax highlighting for most common
  programming languages.  Most other standard programmer's editor features are
  built-in: auto-indent, bracket matching, undo/redo, etc.  Auto-completion
  is available as an add-on library (see http://fifesoft.com/autocomplete).

* Compiling

  RSyntaxTextArea compiles with Gradle.  To compile the source, run all unit
  tests, and create the distribution zip file:
